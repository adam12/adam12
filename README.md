# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Adam][1], a long-time software developer and entrepreneur based in
the Niagara region of Canada. Most of the time I provide consulting to other
organizations through my consultancy, [Mediadrive][2]. But you might also find
me working on one of my startups or micro-bets, such as [DNSLint][3] or [Suspenders][5].

While I am familiar with many languages and technologies, Ruby is my first love,
and most of the software I ship is written in Ruby.

I'll happily work with other languages such as Golang, Crystal, JavaScript, Python,
Elixir.

I started working with Ruby on Rails in 2005, and have come to appreciate the
beautiful Ruby ecosystem outside of Rails. Since 2015, I've been incredibly enamored
with using other fantastic libraries in Ruby, and you'll commonly find me around
the Roda, Rack, Sequel, Hanami, and other communities.

In 2013, I connected with the local grassroots organization [Software Niagara][4],
and loved the community built around this organization so much, that I promptly
injected myself into championing the ongoing organization festivities. Through
the years, we maintained a regular cadence of multiple free events for the local
software community, such as DevTricks.

In that same year, to break the monotony of remote work, I connected with the local
group Cowork Niagara which was meeting twice weekly at a local coffee shop.
The organization aspired for more, and I joined in the formation of
Co-work Niagara Co-operative Inc., as a founding member and Corporate Secretary.
The co-operative went on to open a physical co-working space in downtown
St. Catharines, followed by one located in central St. Catharines. At it's height,
Cowork Niagara served many members and contributed back to the community through
it's hosting of many local organizations, Software Niagara included.

Today, you'll find me mostly working from home.

## Current projects

I recently built [rbz][5] as an experimental Ruby packaging mechanism for
single-file archives (ala `jar`, `phar`, or `shar` of other ecosystems). Crazy?
Maybe. It was based on a Ruby bug tracker ticket from over 9 years prior.

As part of one of my small bets, I've been working on building and shipping
[DNSLint][3], a brandable DNS toolkit for web hosts and MSPs. I've also recently
launched [Suspenders][5], a toolkit for the DirectAdmin control panel, and
[NoDNS.fyi][7], a reverse proxy for previewing websites during migration without
changing DNS.

In an ongoing attempt to improve Ruby documentation, I (along with [Mediadrive][2])
host and support [Gemdocs.org](https://gemdocs.org), an experimental Ruby
documentation hosting website. Gemdocs currently hosts over 2.4 TB of documentation
for published Ruby gems.
